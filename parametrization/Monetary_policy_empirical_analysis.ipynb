    "### Monetary policy for decentralized networks via empirical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical macroeconomic parameter for most decentralized networks is the initial rate at which new tokens are minted (and distributed to actively staking service-providers as a predictable subsidy/incentive) – the _genesis inflation rate_. This analysis aims to substantiate, via empirical analysis, arguments for possible inflation rates at genesis and subsequent monetary policy – by looking at public data from live networks, primarily those secured by staking/Proof-of-Stake.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the protocol designer here is deceptively simple – select an initial rate that's neither too high nor too low. There are issues with both extremes:\n",
    "\n",
    "_'High' inflation rate_\n",
    "- Given a finite supply, a high initial rate implies a shorter-lived era of subsidies. This may not budget enough time for customer adoption and a corresponding transaction fee market to mature. \n",
    "- If the subsidy is too large relative to the typical value of transaction fees, then the incentive to earn fees may be blunted. This is particularly risky if the service-provider action/duty required to collect subsidies does not align well with the equivalent to earn fees, and that latter duty has a greater effect on service quality.\n",
    "- A primary purpose of subsidization is supporting the upfront and maintenance costs of service-provider operations. In the case of NuCypher and some service-layer/staking networks, these overheads are relatively low – particularly when compared to Proof-of-Work mining or networks with very punitive slashing conditions (e.g. for double-signing). Hence, a similarly high inflation rate may be overkill.\n",
    "- A generous subsidy may attract _too many_ service-providers to the network, which means that the first trickle of customers and jobs will be spread more thinly amongst them. Oversupply delays the moment where fees alone are able to sustain service-provider operations. \n",
    "- The greater the value of a subsidy, the further from a customer/fee-driven 'reality' a service-provider's economic set-up is likely to be (for example, in terms of operational efficiency), and the longer it may take for the fee market to catch up – if it catches up at all. \n",
    "- Relatedly, a overly generous subsidy may lead some service-providers to offer unsustainably low prices initially, with the intention of raising prices later once the subsidy dries up [1]. Any customers who have become reliant on the service, but are unable to afford the new higher price point, will see their business thrown into jeoapardy. This prospect will make it harder for would-be network adopters to plan an integration and justify the associated risks and cost-sinking.\n",
    "- Higher subsidies worsen the impact and/or risk of tax liabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "_'Low' inflation rate_\n",
    "- Given competition between networks for competent service-providers, who have finite time and resources, a low incentive may be insufficient to draw and/or maintain a requisite number, diversity or minimum competence level of service-providers. If a truly extreme version of this scenario transpires, we may see supply failing to satisfy demand. \n",
    "- A low value subsidy may lead to collective price-hiking in order to stay afloat [1], which will delay or impede adoption of the network. \n",
    "- An ungenerous subsidy may exclude smaller service-providers with less upfront resources, limiting participation to institutional/professional operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "[1] these scenarios apply in epochs where a free market (price diversity) is enabled or encouraged – i.e. no fixed, enforced, universal pricing. \n",
    "\n",
    "From these qualitative arguments, we may refine the designer's goal: to select a genesis inflation rate that is _as low as possible, without compromising the abundance of supply or the operational feasibility of service-providers_. "

    "Figures are all manually sourced (links below). It is worth noting the inconsistency between networks with respect to their launch style, early inflation schedule, the manner in which rewards are earned, and when data providers began to display price data. In particular, this makes it challenging to choose a fair timeframe over which to compare the networks on their price perfomance – see notes on each network: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cosmos** probably had the 'cleanest' launch of the 6 networks, the arrival of mainnet and inflationary rewards coinciding with the first price data on CMC ([source](https://research.binance.com/projects/cosmos-network)). Like Livepeer, the nomimal inflation rate is linked to the staking rate, but changed very little in the first 6 months. ([source](https://figment.network/resources/cosmos-inflation-staking-rewards-how-are-they-related/)).\n",
    "- **Livepeer's** nominal inflation rate grew steadily for the first year of its existence via a protocol-based mechanism involving the staking rate. This analysis ([source](https://medium.com/vision-hill-blog/modeling-generalized-mining-from-a-funds-perspective-a-livepeer-case-study-54dedac4fdf7)) and the example figure in their whitepaper ([source](https://github.com/livepeer/wiki/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md)) gives us a reasonable estimate of the initial inflation rate – however it is likely to have increased by the time CMC begain providing price data in December 2018, 7 months after their offical mainnet launch. \n",
    "- **Iris's** initial inflation rate and date of first reward emission is unambiguous ([source](https://medium.com/irisnet-blog/iris-foundation-announced-a-one-year-token-burning-plan-e0637ea6f977)), but the first price data on CMC does not appear for another month (in April 2019). \n",
    "- **Algorand's** mainnet announcment and first CMC price data both fall in on June 20th 2019 ([source](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/the-borderless-economy-is-here)). There are no easy-to-find reports of the initial inflation rate, but we can approximate it utilizing this analysis's calculation ([source](https://www.purestake.com/blog/algorand-rewards-distribution-explained/)). \n",
    "- **Synthetix** has CMC price data dating back to March 2018, but at this time it was called Havven and was ostensibly only live on an Ethereum testnet ([source](https://blog.havven.io/nusd-launches-today-e24fbe0ee9c9)). Synthetix did not introduce inflationary rewards until March 2019 ([source](https://blog.synthetix.io/monetary-policy-changes-begin-on-march-13/)). These first rewards were followed by a remarkable performance against BTC (a 201% increase over the next 6 months). It is worth noting that a respectable level of traction, and fees, had been achieved prior to any service-provider subsidization. \n",
    "- **Tezos** recovered from an acrimonious ICO to issue its first rewards approximately 3 weeks after the launch of their 'betanet', in July 2018 ([source](https://cointelegraph.com/news/controversial-tezos-project-announces-launch-of-betanet)). This corresponds with CMC's first estimate of a market capitalization – however, price data for Tezos dates all the way back to October 2nd 2017 – hence, two entries for Tezos are included in the table. The initial inflation rate is generally agreed upon ([source](https://medium.com/cryptium/did-they-pull-the-5-51-out-of-their-oven-understanding-inflation-in-the-tezos-protocol-13493829a533)). "
