### Mint Paper (in progress)

A paper documenting the protocol/economic mechanisms and parameters associated with the NuCypher network that have been implemented, deployed or established with some stability. This does not exclude mechanisms that may change later, but this would necessitate an update to the paper. Sources are in Latex.
